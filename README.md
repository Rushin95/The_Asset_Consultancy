# The_Asset_Consultancy

The Asset Consultancy involves the analysis/prediction of current and future price of real-estate commercials and buildings. The goal is to conduct that depending on analysis/prediction made for the prices of property, whether the customer should invest his money on that property or not. Upon examination of the results, it can be inferred if investing money on the estate would bring out a positive outcome or a negative one, and hence makes the customer aware about the advantages/flaws of investing at the particular place. Data will be fetched from different pre-requisites and compiled at one place producing analysis by an algorithm using Big Data Analysis and its different internal structures, which would be implemented in Java language.

Whenever a person will decide to make an investment in a property, he/she may have to go through various tasks like:

 Visit different sites
 Find a trustworthy broker
 Get details related to each property
 Rely on the reviews of others for making a huge investment

This processes will manually need a lot of time and effort to go through this tedious work and collect information. In such situation, this project would act as a very good tool to make the process of investment and asset analysis easy. The project aims to carry the whole property database online, which can be accessed by the users easily.

The project provides an interface with multiple users i.e. customer, broker and administrator. The customer will use the project for viewing properties, getting analysis from the past records of the property market and also interact with the broker. The broker will post the associated properties and will benefit from this system as the customers can view those properties and contact him. The project works on the creating a trustable result out of a large amount of data provided by the broker. The administrator takes care of the authenticity of the registered broker as well as the property details updated in the system database.
